# Implementing User Activities for Android

User Activities are data constructs that represent a user's tasks within an application. They make it possible to save a snapshot of a task to be continued at a later time. The [Windows Timeline](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/04/27/make-the-most-of-your-time-with-the-new-windows-10-update/) feature presents Windows users with a scrollable list of all their recent activities, represented as cards with text and graphics. For more information about User Activities in general, see [Continue user activity, even across devices](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/useractivities). For recommendations on when to create or update Activities, see the [User Activities best practices](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/useractivities-best-practices) guide.

With the Project Rome SDK, your Android app can not only publish User Activities for use in Windows features such as Timeline, but can also act as an endpoint and read Activities back to the user just as Timeline does on Windows devices. This allows cross-device apps to transcend their platforms and provide experiences that follow users rather than devices.  

See the [API reference](api-reference-for-android.md) page for links to the reference docs relevant to these scenarios.

This steps below will reference code from the [Project Rome Android sample app](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-rome/tree/master/Android/samples).

## Using the platform

[!INCLUDE [android/create-setup-events-start-platform](../includes/android/create-setup-events-start-platform.md)]

### Initialize a User Activity channel

To implement User Activity features in your app, you will first need to initialize the user activity feed by creating a UserActivityChannel. You should treat this like the Platform initialization step above: it should be checked and possibly redone whenever the app comes to the foreground (but not before Platform initialization).

You will also need your cross-platform app ID, which was retrieved through the Microsoft Developer Dashboard registration.
The following methods initialize a UserActivityChannel.

```Java
private UserActivityChannel mActivityChannel;
private UserDataFeed mUserDataFeed;

// ...

/**
 * Initializes the UserActivityFeed.
 */
public void initializeUserActivityFeed() {

    // define what scope of data this app needs
    SyncScope[] scopes = { UserActivityChannel.getSyncScope(), UserNotificationChannel.getSyncScope() };

    // Get a reference to the UserDataFeed. This method is defined below
    mUserDataFeed = getUserDataFeed(scopes, new EventListener<UserDataFeed, Void>() {
        @Override
        public void onEvent(UserDataFeed userDataFeed, Void aVoid) {
            if (userDataFeed.getSyncStatus() == UserDataSyncStatus.SYNCHRONIZED) {
                // log synchronized.
            } else {
                // log synchronization not completed.
            }
        }
    });

    // this method is defined below
    mActivityChannel = getUserActivityChannel();
}

// instantiate the UserDataFeed
private UserDataFeed getUserDataFeed(SyncScope[] scopes, EventListener<UserDataFeed, Void> listener) {
    UserAccount[] accounts = AccountProviderBroker.getSignInHelper().getUserAccounts();
    if (accounts.length <= 0) {
        // notify the user that sign-in is required
        return null;
    }

    // use the initialized Platform instance, along with the cross-device app ID.
    UserDataFeed feed = UserDataFeed.getForAccount(accounts[0], PlatformBroker.getPlatform(), Secrets.APP_HOST_NAME);
    feed.addSyncStatusChangedListener(listener);
    feed.addSyncScopes(scopes);
    // sync data with the server
    feed.startSync();
    return feed;
}

// use the UserDataFeed reference to create a UserActivityChannel
@Nullable
private UserActivityChannel getUserActivityChannel() {
    UserActivityChannel channel = null;
    try {
        // create a UserActivityChannel for the signed in account
        channel = new UserActivityChannel(mUserDataFeed);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        // handle exception
    }
    return channel;
}
```

At this point, you should have a UserActivityChannel reference in mActivityChannel.


### Create and publish a User Activity

Next, set the ID, DisplayText and ActivationURI data of what will be a new **UserActivity**. The ID should be a unique String. The DisplayText will be shown on other devices when they view the Activity (in Windows Timeline, for example), so it should be a concise description of the activity. The ActivationUri will determine what action is taken when the **UserActivity** is activated (when it is selected in Timeline, for example). The following code fills in sample data for these fields.


```Java
private UserActivity mActivity;
private String mActivityId;
private String mDisplayText;
private String mActivationUri;

// ...

mActivityId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
mDisplayText = "Created by OneSDK Sample App";
mActivationUri = "http://contoso.com");
```

Next, provide a method that creates a new **UserActivity** instance.

```Java
// Create the UserActivity (with unique ID) using a custom method. 
mActivity = createUserActivity(mActivityChannel, mActivityId);

// ...

// Custom method for creating a new UserActivity
@Nullable
private UserActivity createUserActivity(UserActivityChannel channel, String activityId)
{
    UserActivity activity = null;
    AsyncOperation<UserActivity> activityOperation = channel.getOrCreateUserActivityAsync(activityId);
    try {
        activity = activityOperation.get();
        Log.d("UserActivityFragment","Created user activity successfully");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        Log.d("UserActivityFragment","Created user activity successfully");
    }
    return activity;
}
```
Once you have the **UserActivity** instance, populate it with the data defined above.

```Java
//set the properties of the UserActivity:
// Display Text will be shown when the UserActivity is viewed on other devices
mActivity.getVisualElements().setDisplayText(mDisplayText);
// ActivationURI will determine what is launched when your UserActivity is activated from other devices
mActivity.setActivationUri(mActivationUri);
```

Finally, publish the Activity to the cloud. 

```Java
// This code saves and publishes the activity
AsyncOperation<Void> operation = mActivity.saveAsync();
operation.whenCompleteAsync(new AsyncOperation.ResultBiConsumer<Void, Throwable>() {
    @Override
    public void accept(Void aVoid, Throwable throwable) throws Throwable {
        if (throwable != null)
        {
            Log.d("UserActivityFragment", "Failed to save");
        } else {
            Log.d("UserActivityFragment", "User activity saved");
        }
    }
});
```

> [!TIP] 
> In addition to the properties above, there are many other features that can be configured. For a complete look at the different ways that a UserActivity can be customized, see the **[UserActivity](/java/api/com.microsoft.connecteddevices.userdata.useractivities.useractivity)**, **[UserActivityVisualElements](/java/api/com.microsoft.connecteddevices.userdata.useractivities.useractivityvisualelements)**, and **[UserActivityAttribution](/java/api/com.microsoft.connecteddevices.userdata.useractivities.useractivityattribution)** classes. See the [User Activities best practices](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/useractivities-best-practices) guide for detailed recommendations on how to design User Activities.

### Update an existing User Activity

If you have an existing Activity and wish to update its information (in the event of a new engagement, changed page, and so on), you can do so by using a **UserActivitySession**.

```Java
private UserActivitySession mActivitySession;

// ...

if (mActivity != null)
{
    // create a session from a previous UserActivity instance.
    mActivitySession = mActivity.createSession();
    Log.d("UserActivityFragment", "Starting");
}
```

Once you've created a session, your app can make any desired changes to the properties of the **UserActivity**. When you're done making changes, close the session. 

```Java
mActivitySession.close();
mActivitySession = null;
Log.d("UserActivityFragment", "Stopping");
```

A **UserActivitySession** can be thought of as a way to create a **UserActivitySessionHistoryItem** (covered in the next section). Rather than create a new **UserActivity** every time a user moves to a new page, you can simply create a new session for each page. This will make for a more intuitive and organized activity reading experience.

### Read User Activities

Your app can read User Activities and present them to the user just as the Windows Timeline feature does. To set up User Activity reading, use the same **UserActivityChannel** instance from earlier. This instance can expose **UserActivitySessionHistoryItem** instances, which represent a user's engagement in a particular Activity during a specific period of time.

```Java
private ArrayList<UserActivitySessionHistoryItem> mHistoryItems; 

// ...

mHistoryItems.clear();

Log.d("UserActivityFragment", "Read");
//Async method to read activities. Last (most recent) 5 activities will be returned
AsyncOperation<UserActivitySessionHistoryItem[]> operation = mActivityChannel.getRecentUserActivitiesAsync(5);

operation.whenCompleteAsync(new AsyncOperation.ResultBiConsumer<UserActivitySessionHistoryItem[], Throwable>() {
    @Override
    public void accept(UserActivitySessionHistoryItem[] result, Throwable throwable) throws Throwable {
        if (throwable != null)
        {
            Log.d("UserActivityFragment", "Failed to read user activity!" + throwable.getMessage() + " " + throwable.getStackTrace());
        } else {
            // get the returned UserActivitySessionHistoryItems
            for (UserActivitySessionHistoryItem item : result)
            {
                mHistoryItems.add(item);
            }
        }
    }
});
```

Now your app should have a populated list of **UserActivitySessionHistoryItem**s. Each of these can deliver the underlying **UserActivity** (see **[UserActivitySessionHistoryItem](/java/api/com.microsoft.connecteddevices.userdata.useractivities.useractivitysessionhistoryitem)** for details), which you can then display to the user.
